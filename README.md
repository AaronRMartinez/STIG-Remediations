# The Cyber Range: STIG Remediations

Within this repository are PowerShell scripts designed to automate the remediation of STIGs identified through a Tenable vulnerability scan on virtual machines within the Cyber Range network.

A **STIG (Security Technical Implementation Guide)** is a set of cybersecurity guidelines developed by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) to ensure the secure configuration of systems, software, and networks used by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). Purpose of a STIG:

- Standardizes security configurations for IT assets.
- Reduces vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.
- Ensures compliance with DoD security requirements.
